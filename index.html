<h1>Privacy Policy for EYEJI </h1>
<p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> October 23, 2025</p>

<p>Dubezz ("we," "us," or "our") operates the EYEJI mobile application (the "Service"). This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal data when you use our Service.</p>

<h2>1. Data Collection and Use</h2>
<p>The core purpose of EYEJI is to help users maintain a healthy viewing distance from their device screen. To achieve this, the app requires access to certain device features.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Camera Access:</strong> The app uses your device's front-facing camera. This access is solely for the purpose of calculating the distance between your user's face and the device's screen in real-time.</li>
    <li><strong>Data Processing:</strong> The camera feed is processed live, on your device only. <strong>No images or videos are ever stored, saved, or transmitted off your device.</strong> We do not collect, store, or share any personal data, images, or identifiers from the camera. The processing is ephemeral and happens entirely on your device.</li>
</ul>

<h2>2. Permissions Required</h2>
<p>EYEJI requests the following permissions to function correctly:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>CAMERA:</strong> Required to analyze the distance from the device screen.</li>
    <li><strong>VIBRATE:</strong> Required to provide vibration alerts when the user is too close.</li>
    <li><strong>POST_NOTIFICATIONS:</strong> Required to send distance alert notifications.</li>
    <li><strong>FOREGROUND_SERVICE_CAMERA:</strong> Required to allow the optional background monitoring to function while the app is minimized, ensuring continuous protection.</li>

<p>We encourage you to review Google's Privacy Policy: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a></p>

<h2>4. Children's Privacy</h2>
<p>Our Service is designed to help protect the eye health of all users, including children. We do not knowingly collect any personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13. All data processing from the camera is done on the device and is not collected or stored.</p>

<h2>5. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.</p>
